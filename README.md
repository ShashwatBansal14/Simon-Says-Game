# Simon Says Game
## Overview

The **Simon Says Game** is a classic memory game where players have to recall and repeat an increasingly long sequence of flashing lights on four colored blocks. One block flashes, and players need to keep guessing the sequence, remembering all previous flashes in the correct order.

## How to Play

1. The game starts by flashing one block.
2. The player must click the correct block that matches the flash.
3. In the next round, a new block will flash in addition to the previous one.
4. The player must remember the sequence and click the blocks in the correct order.
5. The game continues as the sequence gets longer with each round.
6. If the player clicks the wrong block, the game ends, and the player can start over.

## Features

- **Memory challenge**: Test your memory as the sequence of blocks grows with every round.
- **User interaction**: Players click on the blocks to match the sequence.
- **Game over mechanism**: The game ends when the player makes a mistake.
- **Score tracking**: See how far you can get before you make an error!
